# CodeInPlace-FinalProject
ColorCollage App --> I built as my final project as a student in Code In Place. Takes an image can creates a grid (of the desired number of rows and columns) composed of the same image but with random color filters. Has the option to "mirror" the image sideways or top to bottom to make the collage more interesting.
